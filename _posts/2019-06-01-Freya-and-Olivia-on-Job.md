*Olivia*: Hi, Freya. How are you? I heard you left the job? 
*Freya*: Yes, I did last month, it seems not working there anymore.

*Olivia*: Alright, so what's next. Any cool adventure waiting?
*Freya*: I don't know, Will rest for few days, look into science, how planets moves and blackholes. Am sure will something good... 


*Olivia*: Okay, but you already have a degree in physics, Are you planning for a PhD?
*Freya*: PhD, No way. I won't be. Look, this path is rubbish now. The PhD programmes are a business and scam, They have crossed the limits.

*Olivia*: I don't agree. Tell me… If they won't make it business, don't have deadlines and it's people don't wanna work anymore.
*Freya*: No that’s not the case, Why would they work? People love to work, they will… You tell me who wants to sit ideal, everyone wants to have a purpose in life. Let me someone who doesn't want to have a purpose in life

*Olivia*: Yes true, but it doesn't mean that you stop enjoying things.
*Freya*: Well but it's not that everyone can enjoy it all the time. If I ask you to enjoy it all the time, a day will come when you will be bored of enjoying it. If I give you billions ..do whatever you want to do... Okay then you can sit ideal for a day, let's say a year, then you might get a villa, car, but something will motivate you to work. If the persons are not motivated then there won't be any painter, artist, poet in the world or will they be.

*Olivia*: Yes that’s written but how many are those, One two… you will count you will come to know that the reality and practicality of this thought are rare.
*Freya*: NO there are, there are millions, the history is full of them, the books with their pages are full of them. It's just that you don't ready, which is a different story. If you see those pages that mean there are people who might have done that right.

*Olivia*: If someone does something full time he would definitely need money.
*Freya*: Yes absolutely one would require money to survive but that’s a different story. Working for money is a different case, One case is that a man works something that he is interested in. The work a man does is his reflection. If a man gets work and he does it, he sees himself in that job, with that position as his ambition. If the work is good, he feels it's as personal pride. And if the work is a personal reflection of the man then the man is also a reflection of his work. So let's say that there is a work that's soul-crushing, then what imagine what would be the state of that man…

*Olivia*: Hmm, that makes sense He would be waiting for Friday, will drink on Saturday, sleep on Sunday and goes to work on Monday. So what do you think is the solution for this. Do you have any solution?
*Freya*: I don't know how exactly, but this is what is happening in London now, right. The whole office follows the same routine.

*Olivia*: Don’t you think that they are enjoying this life, for them, this is a paradise for them
*Freya*: No no never, they aren't enjoying it, They all have to make a fool of themselves. Somehow they have agreed to this. If you speak to someone for even five minutes you would can to know that he is enjoying, when you speak with them for 15 min you will come to know that this is pointless. I have spoken to many and everyone has said it awesome but after 15 min you will come to know that life is getting scum

*Olivia*: When I have talked to anyone the last thing that comes up is that drink and enjoy, who knows the futures.
